<h1>My Hobby</h1>
<h2>1. The hobby page should do the following:</h2>
<h3>* Introduce yourself and your hobby.</h3>
<p>My name is Mois&eacute;s (with an accent mark on the letter E) I also go by MOY Moy (Rhymes with boy)<br />I was born and raised in Mexico. My family and I migrated to the US 30 years ago. I currently live in the Mission/Castro districts in San Francisco</p>
<h3>* Describe why you enjoy doing this hobby.</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>One of the things I enjoy the most, my hobby, is some interior design and includes mainly repurposing furniture and creating art pieces.</li>
<li>This hobby got me thru the toughest days during the pandemic as I was permanently in lockdown in my apartment.</li>
<li>It is not only entertaining but highly therapeutic to me.</li>
<li>I do accounting and small business consulting for a living. Doing this, taps into my left/right side of the brain or what is known as cognitive thinking.</li>
<li>However, I find most of my inspiration from many different artists. I am a highly visual individual. I really enjoy observing art in all forms. That eventually gives ideas that I adapt into my own.</li>
<li>I find used furniture on the streets or discarded pieces of art and I give them a new life.<br />Most of the ideas come from my head.</li>
<li>Craigslist</li>
</ol>
