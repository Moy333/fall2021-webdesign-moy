My Hobby
1. The hobby page should do the following:
* Introduce yourself and your hobby.
My name is Mois√©s (with an accent mark on the letter E) I also go by MOY Moy (Rhymes with boy)
I was born and raised in Mexico. My family and I migrated to the US 30 years ago. I currently live in the Mission/Castro districts in San Francisco

* Describe why you enjoy doing this hobby.
One of the things I enjoy the most, my hobby, is some interior design and includes mainly repurposing furniture and creating art pieces.
This hobby got me thru the toughest days during the pandemic as I was permanently in lockdown in my apartment.
It is not only entertaining but highly therapeutic to me.
I do accounting and small business consulting for a living. Doing this, taps into my left/right side of the brain or what is known as cognitive thinking.
However, I find most of my inspiration from many different artists. I am a highly visual individual. I really enjoy observing art in all forms. That eventually gives ideas that I adapt into my own.
I find used furniture on the streets or discarded pieces of art and I give them a new life.
Most of the ideas come from my head.

* Links to online resources or videos where the reader can visit to further develop their skills in your hobby.
