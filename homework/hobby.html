        <h2>My name is Mois&eacute;s (with an accent mark on the letter E) I also go by MOY Moy (Rhymes with boy)</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>I was born and raised in Mexico. My family and I migrated to the US 30 years ago. I currently live in the Mission/Castro districts in San Francisco.</li>
        <li>One of the things I enjoy the most, my hobby, is some interior design and includes mainly repurposing furniture and creating art pieces.</li>
        <li>This hobby got me thru the toughest days during the pandemic as I was permanently in lockdown in my apartment.</li>
        <li>It is not only entertaining but highly therapeutic to me.</li>
        <li>I do accounting and small business consulting for a living. Doing this, taps into my left/right side of the brain or what is known as cognitive thinking.</li>
        <li>I find used furniture on the streets or discarded pieces of art and I give them a new life.</li>
        <li>Most of the ideas come from my head. However, I find most of my inspiration from many different artists. I am a highly visual individual. I really enjoy observing art in all forms. That eventually gives ideas that I adapt into my own.</li>
